# Grocery Store Items Association

According to an article by the BBC, Tesco stated that men who buy babies nappies are likely to put cans of beer in their shopping trolley too. Research by Tesco revealed a strong link between nappies and beer purchases by male customers. A store may use this information to increase sales figures, for instance, putting beer at the top shelf and nappies on the shelves below. 

In a general sense, if it were possible for stores to get an idea of the association rules, they could be implemented to structure the store layout in order to increase the probability of higher customer spending. For example, if a typical customer purchases bread and milk as a part of their weekly shop, seperating these products in order to maximise the distance travelled between these two products that have high association will allow customers to be exposed to a wide range of products in between. This increases the probability of customers purchasing additional products they would not have initially bought.  

We will be analysing the shopping baskets of customers to learn product associations and therefore customer behaviour. In order for us to learn these associations, we will be using the "Apriori" association rule learning algorithm.
